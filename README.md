# Tasks
The idea of this project is to create a full-stack website that will allow a user to create a list of long-term goals and daily tasks. A full-stack website using Mongoose, Node.js, and Express for the backend. The user's homepage will see a list of tasks that will refresh daily. In order to add to the list, the user will have to go to the 'Dailies' tab. The 'Todo' tab is used for long term goals the user wishes to achieve.
